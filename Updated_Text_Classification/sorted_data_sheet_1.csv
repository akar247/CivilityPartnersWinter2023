I've never felt it was a bad work environment with my peers.,Positive
"I feel like the nurses that I work with, we’ve worked together a long time. We work well together.",Positive
One of our strongest assets is that we are a tight knit group. We have a small team and so everyone knows each other well.,Positive
"There’s a lot of team work, especially amongst the staff. Overall for day shift and night shift there is teamwork. Everyone here will help you if you asked.",Positive
"On days, we are like a family, it’s a well run machine.",Positive
It’s a great unit. There’s some people with great knowledge. When stuff goes wrong everyone works together. It’s not all horrible. The patients get really good care.,Positive
Adam is making positive change,Positive
I don”t have a lack of trust.,Positive
I have a good relationship with both Tanya and Adam.,Positive
I love my managers. They get a 10/10. They have flexibility and communication.,Positive
My contract was only going to be for 4 weeks and I’ve stayed because of Tanya.,Positive
For the most part we get along well with Tanya and Adam.,Positive
They are helpful. I usually don’t have managers volunteering to come in.,Positive
I don’t see a traveler vs. non traveler divide.,Positive
For the most part the relationship between nurses and travel nurses is good.,Positive
I think the staff and traveler nurses get along really well.,Positive
"When they show they can do the job and are willing, they are totally accepted.",Positive
In general we all get along well. We appreciate them.,Positive
"If a traveler is showing up and doing their job, I think staff nurses are appreciative.",Positive
For the most part the relationship between nurses and travel nurses is good.,Positive
The staff nurse does take good care of the travelers.,Positive
We’ve had some really great travelers.,Positive
I think most of the travel nurses are competent.,Positive
We have a lot to learn from one another.,Positive
Most of the travelers that we work with have been amazing.  They bring in perspectives from other organizations.,Positive
When we need the help and they are willing to be helpful. The staff is very receptive and appreciative and work well with those travelers.,Positive
We learn alot from the travelers. It's a good symbiotic relationship. They’re hard workers lots of times. They bring in their experience from other facilities.,Positive
The nurses know what they are doing.,Positive
They are incredibly strong nurses. I am proud of the work they do.,Positive
I think the nurses are very good nurses. They have good clinical skills.,Positive
"The staff nurses are very clinically strong, they care deeply and are bright and skilled at their jobs. I trust them.",Positive
"The nurses here are fantastic, wonderful. The patients that come here are really lucky, we give really good care.",Positive
I am optimistic about the way things are going now.,Positive
Since Adam started it has been better. He does try to get our input and listen to us and put our needs first.,Positive
"Adam has been asking our opinions and he will bring us aside and get our thoughts. Or he will ask, “how does this work here?”",Positive
In the last couple of months they have been trying to bring us in. Tanya invited me to a meeting last week. That's a step in the right direction.,Positive
During negotiations you can tell the nurses were stressed. It affected the way we were communicating.,Negative
I think a lot of the disgruntled nurses come from the fact that there is no union contract. Nurses don’t feel valued.,Negative
The contract with the union is a huge issue and the honesty from management is the root of a lot of our problems.,Negative
There’s been multiple years of negotiation while still being asked to show up and do your job everyday and then the pandemic. Now you have a group of nurses who are working really hard and feeling how they were feeling with the negotiations and now we are put into these conditions where everyone feels uncertain.,Negative
I think the mistrust comes from the lack of union contract. It’s not from management. There's a lack of transparency from the administrative level.,Negative
I feel like between management and the staff there is poor communication.,Negative
Passing along important information about changes has not been effective or not communicated at all.,Negative
"In 2019 they came up with the idea of keeping neonates longer. They did this whole fundraiser saying we will be a level 2 nursery, but they didn’t ask our opinion at all. None of us have had the training to keep babies.",Negative
I don’t feel like I've gotten clear direction until I was in my performance review.,Negative
Communication between management and nurses and then between travelers is our biggest issue.,Negative
"They change the way we were doing things in the OR when we were doing C-sections. They didn’t communicate this to me and I was in a c-section and the tech was saying, “no we aren’t doing that,” and I had to run and grab a sterile drape to catch the baby. It creates dangerous situations when things aren’t relayed to us.",Negative
They could bring the nurses in when it comes to things like visitor policies - there was no representation of the floor nurses in those decisions.,Negative
We’ve had issues with the lab and pharmacy.  We rely on other departments to get things to us quickly. Pharmacy got all twisted about that (mixing a pharmacy bag) shouldn't have been an issue.,Negative
Lab has a different computer system than we do. We can’t see if something is ordered.,Negative
"Lab, there is some weird thing, the charting system we use doesn't interface so they don’t get a lot of the stuff we need. EPIC was supposed to solve that but it didn't.",Negative
The lab is my biggest complaint.,Negative
"I drew the labs and walked in and all the lights were off in the lab. I’m screaming hello is anyone here and got nothing. I started opening random doors and then the guy comes out with the blanket over his head like I was bothering him. And he said, “I don't know how to work this system and this person has to do it, I’m just here.”",Negative
"Lab and labor and delivery have had a very tense relationship. There will be things we send down and I’ll have it ordered and they won’t run it. I’ll have something ordered and they won’t draw it because the doctor didn’t sign it, but they won’t tell us why they didn't draw it. Then you have to call them and ask what happened. They could call me and said what they needed and I could get that done. They try to avoid us at all times when we could work together to make it easier.",Negative
Lab is bad. There are 2-3 that make it bad for the rest of us. They won’t call and talk to nurses. This has been going on for years.,Negative
Pediatricians and OB’s are not working together. So that's a real gap. They should work together more to identify moms that really shouldn't deliver here if they have a choice.,Negative
Pediatricians and OB need to come together to say whether or not we are willing to accept this risk.,Negative
There's a lot of tension between OB and OR. Nurses from those dept constantly but heads.,Negative
There are complaints from the surgery department and every department that OB is difficult to work with.,Negative
There could be more collaboration between the obstetricians and pediatricians around high risk patients and if it’s appropropriate for them to deliver here.,Negative
"I had to take care of the baby and we didn’t have the nursery set up appropriately. Had we been more involved, we could have provided better care. We could use some collaboration on OB, Peds and nursing in determining appropriate care. We need to assess whether certain patients should deliver.",Negative
There could be more clarity in the interview process for travelers that you are going to have to take babies at some point.,Negative
"Staff nurses say travelers need to not be rejected assignments, but it’s more about the interview and being more clear and getting people with nursery experience.",Negative
"The crisis nurses are hired and they aren’t interviewed and they tend to be the least flexible. We can specify what we want, but sometimes the recruiters are not honest. That leads to flexibility.",Negative
"A lot of the traveling nurses are refusing to take care of babies, I'm not sure how the hiring goes and it feels like expectations aren't set with what they will be doing. They need to know what is expected of them.",Negative
We have a nursery and when Tanya interviewed me she didn’t say anything about nursery expectations. To protect my license I can’t take on nursery outside of my competencies because I can be held personally accountable whereas the staff nurses are covered by the hospital.,Negative
I don’t expect full closed mindedness from the top. A little curiosity would go a long way.,Negative
The nurses should be included in decisions because we are the ones taking care of the patients.,Negative
The nurses don’t feel like anyone is listening to them or that their concerns are being addressed.,Negative
April is stressed out at night. She is by herself with all these travelers and they don’t get any training. I don’t think April feels supported.,Negative
It seems as though our manager doesn’t ask our opinion on things. We aren’t brought in on decisions that are made.,Negative
We just want to feel supported and want to change things when we have concerns as opposed to brushing it off like it doesn’t mean anything. She doesn’t bring us into the equation of anything that’s changing or anything thats new. It feels like we are disrespected in that regard.,Negative
"The problem I've seen is that when things are brought up by staff, especially concerning travelers, they need to be listened to a lot sooner before things get worse. It’s not that we are picking on the travelers.",Negative
I get scared about babies. We don’t really have resources for sick babies. We don’t know this stuff and we are waiting hours until we can transfer the baby.,Negative
The CNO and Clint they don’t care. They say one thing and do another. They say they want to be supportive and turn around and don’t.,Negative
"People just need to communicate more, if they have things that are upsetting them, maybe bring it to the whole group. Maybe there’s a way to even write on a piece of paper, put it in a bag, and everyone talks about these things that people are having grievances about.",Negative
"We don’t like when upper admin, like Clint or Julie come into our department. It's uncomfortable because we don't have any trust in them, because of this whole union thing we don’t feel respected. We wish they would stay away and we feel like they are pretending to care.",Negative
"Some of the more veteran nurses think, “this is how I’ve always done it.”",Negative
People aren’t open to change. It's difficult to be nimble.,Negative
They [the day nurses] weren’t welcoming with Adam. I don’t feel they are willing to change or hear what he is trying to say.,Negative
"What I’ve noticed in the department is that in general they have a hard time thinking outside of the box. In a way they have this short of victim mentality like, “nobody can help us, we are alone, nobody cares about us.”",Negative
"There are nurses who have been in the unit for 20+ years and they see things as,”this is how things have always been done,” I think they lack confidence in management because they’ve seen managers come and go.",Negative
"They (referring to more veteran nurses) are all friendly to me, but it was, “you aren’t going to get what you want with the schedule.” The attitude is, “this is how it’s going to be.”",Negative
"The staff nurses have issues with change of things - even the travelers who have been here for a while. They don’t like change and so when there are things that are new their response is just to shut it down and say, “we don’t do that here,” and go back to what they are used to doing.",Negative
"There is a lot of talking behind someone’s back. Rather than saying, “hey you did this differently,” That person walks away and then there are 6 side conversations about it. It’d be better if we were just honest to each other to their faces.",Negative
The travelers have brought more diversity in thought which I think is challenging to the staff nurses.,Negative
You have a lot of the day nurses who have been here many many years - they are the biggest push back on the unit when it comes to trying to change things.,Negative
Seems like people respect one another to their faces and talk between their backs.,Negative
There are certain nurses who will talk crap behind your back or ignore you and then others who will say something to your face.,Negative
You’ll walk away and then they are whispering about stuff going on.,Negative
It’s a small space where we work at the nurses station and you hear everything. It feels like venting in a shared space and it can get intense and feel negative.,Negative
"There is a lot of talking behind someone’s back. Rather than saying, “hey you did this differently,” That person walks away and then there are 6 side conversations about it. It’d be better if we were just honest to each other to their faces.",Negative
"If you have an issue with how I managed the patient then she should talk to me about it, because it should be about the patient. Obviously she didn’t have a problem, she just wanted to be mean.",Negative
I feel like it’s people who have been here a long time and they are just done. They are complaining about every little thing but it’s draining.,Negative
They act fake like nothing ever happened and then they are complaining behind the scenes. They will never do the direct face to face approach. They will go behind. It’s very gossipy and catty - I’ll say this is all day shift.,Negative
"There were a few times where nurses who I really thought I had a good relationship with misunderstood what I had to say; rather than coming to be they went behind my back and talk to someone else; so then I tried to talk to this person and they said, “you can talk to my union rep”",Negative
"Nobody has respect for OB. They are always mean to other departments, to the kitchen, to lab, to pharmacy, their attitudes are horrible.",Negative
The complaining comes mostly from day shift.,Negative
"They complain in the open. I usually walk off. This happens on the day shift, not the night shift.",Negative
"The day shift will say, “did you get that email about xyz?” I can see them feeling some type of way about so many travelers.",Negative
There are definitely more individuals on the day shift - I know that if there are certain combinations of people - there are people that stir up that drama.,Negative
The day shift nurses will freak out. It's a lot of ranting and we have a small nursing station and you just hope it doesn't go to the patients rooms.,Negative
The complaining comes mostly from day shift. I think they whine more and I don’t think they realize how easy they have it. Every little thing is an issue. They bicker a lot.,Negative
"Day shift is less comfortable working to help the entire hospital, they just want to work with labor and delivery patients. When these new patients come in their communication gets aggressive.",Negative
There are some tough personalities on day shift.,Negative
A lot of them are bullies. They don’t make you feel like a part of the team.,Negative
The day shift nurses are definitely not welcoming to new people from the outside trying to change things.,Negative
The day nurses can be a tough crowd in terms of accepting new people and change in general.,Negative
They like to search for night shift issues to bring to light so everyone can see that night shift didn’t do it. They are ridiculously minor things that they call out.,Negative
There is a complete divide with night shift and day shift. We are completely different animals. I feel like day shift has their own cliques and they run how they want to run.,Negative
The schedule is the worst part. They get what they want and if you are trying to change that in any way it gets heated. They get 8 weeks of vacation a year and so new staff came in and we didn’t have anything to choose from and nobody would give us a vacation. So the entire year is taken for vacation.,Negative
"The people who have been here a long time on day shift, it’s a negative atmosphere.",Negative
"When people come in, as soon as they come in, it’s just like, “what have you not done, let me pick apart everything you did on your shift.” I’m trying to hold the unit together and they are picking it apart.",Negative
It’s like a catty family of women. It has a lot of way to do with how our nurses station is. They sit in this bubble and they fight all day. It’s between each other too.,Negative
They bicker with each other. When they are trying to divide patients up they are bickering about who is going to get what and we are standing there.,Negative
"They fight about their schedule a lot, especially with the newer people.",Negative
A few of them are used to being way too concerned about other peoples schedules. They fight about who has too many days off and that does not happen on the night shift.,Negative
There isn’t any fighting amongst the night shift that there is on days.,Negative
They are so married into the idea that Barton is a bad place that they can’t see any good.,Negative
"There are some nurses that are very negative about everything just everything, hospital everything.",Negative
"They don’t want to do any of the work, no patients, just sit on their phones and bitch and bitch about admin.",Negative
"That person is very vocal and dramatic and if she’s in a good mood, everybody feels it and a bad mood, it’s a bad day.",Negative
"Nobody has respect for OB. They are always mean to other departments, to the kitchen, to lab, to pharmacy, their attitudes are horrible.",Negative
"Someone on a great day could say, “this unit is horrible and Barton is out to get me,” but the hyperbole and exaggeration perpetuates the negative culture.",Negative
"The nurses deserve and demand respect, but I don’t feel like they respect management and admins.",Negative
Tammy rolls her eyes and calls me out whenever I give her a compliment and says “oh sure.”,Negative
"It goes from cold to hot depending on who is around. If they are in a negative cycle they are mad at everyone. It’s, “the lab is late and I can’t find anyone,” etc. They get themselves into this cycle where everything is bad. Then some days it is fine.",Negative
"The nurses speak in these absolutes like, “Barton always does xyz,” and it creates the impression of a closed mind.",Negative
"I would walk in and say, “hey how are you doing,” and people wouldn’t respond or respond with an outwardly negative response. It was complaining about everything.",Negative
It was horrible when we were busy or horrible when we weren't busy.,Negative
"A few key players that are more vocal and negative spoiled the pot for the shift. That's why some nurses left, everyone is so down about Barton and their job.",Negative
"When I was trying to redirect some of the negativity a few weeks ago I brought up on the call - the initial response was, “oh well that just happened two years ago,” they are trying to discount the positives. Anytime I bring up a positive around Barton Health the veteran nurses find a way to discount it.",Negative
"The nurses constantly complain about administration, their salary and their contract and all of that. And that doesn’t allow them to see anything positive. They spilled over into them being mean about the patients. Like they will say snarking things about the patients or families - they aren’t using their most empathetic selves. They don’t say it in front of the patient but they bring it back to the nursing station.",Negative
"I’ve noticed some of the language to describe patients in shift changes has been unprofessional. For example, making fun of someone for their education level or saying, “she’s horrible, goodluck.” The nurse sets up the new nurse coming on to look for those negative behaviors.",Negative
When there is conflict it happens in the open and it’s frustrating. Some of the stuff that’s said is unprofessional and it could carry into the patients rooms.,Negative
"There were always a few people that were just negative and then the election and the whole political thing kicked in. There were people coming to work and there was name calling. They were pulling up stuff about what was happening on the election and twitter and constantly looking at their phones and making comments about what they're seeing. Politically, there would be one person that said “anybody who’s voting for Trump would be a disgust if they have girls.”",Negative
It feels like there is a jadedness from staff nurses.,Negative
The day staff nurses - it’s the language they use. They are based in history. They launch into the litany of wrongs about the discretions of Barton over the years.,Negative
There are people in the negative group that hang on to things that happened even before I’ve been here.,Negative
I’d go to OB and they’d give me this long elaborate story and as I dove into it I’d find out it happened like 10 years ago. They still tend to do that.,Negative
"There are a lot of, “this happened 5 years ago.” Then I’ll ask them if they feel Barton has changed since then and they say no, but can’t give examples of how they haven’t changed.",Negative
"Every time someone new comes in, there is always an issue with Tawny. She’s hypercritical. She takes high ownership of the unit.",Negative
"Tami has a very long record of her mouth getting her in trouble. She’s unappreciative, feeds the negativity. But I have a soft spot shes been here the longest time ever. She doesn't believe in anybody anymore, she doesn't trust anybody.",Negative
Christy Yaeter - every day she finds something negative to say about Tanya. Not appreciative of anybody. She doesn’t like Tanya and has turned all the staff against Tanya. She’s the biggest bully. She finds something and talks about it for the rest of the day.,Negative
"There's a person that works at the end of and beginning of week, per diem. And she is basically the most negative person I've encountered. She turns everyone negative. And turns the end of week people negative very quickly.",Negative
"No scaled amount of pay for nurses, not that I know. No justification of their pay.",Negative
No standardized pay.,Negative
"Before the pay increase, there was a lot of conversation between the disparity of pay.",Negative
"There's no equal scale, someone could come in and get more pay cause that’s what they asked for. (The increase made everyone feel satiated)",Negative
We need staff nurses and those that came in at higher pay and then they said they'd stay if they kept that higher pay. So that’s higher than those that have been here 20 years.,Negative
The travelers are making x amount more than the staff nurses then the staff nurses are wondering why the travelers aren’t working harder then them.,Negative
We know how much the travelers are making and how much they are paying for the hotels and then they are coming to us saying they are going to take us to collections because they overpaid us. That’s putting a bad taste in our mouth.,Negative
There are patient safety issues.,Negative
We aren’t trained for NICU and I feel it's doing a disservice to the patients.,Negative
"There isn’t enough training, they are throwing people out into the wild and then we are asking questions to staff members and they don’t even know.",Negative
"They need to be trained for c-sections. If that decision is made, train them appropriately. Decision may be above my pay grade.",Negative
We have never had training other than online modules (nicu). I don’t have a resource person here to assure I’m going down the right path.,Negative
"I think they are afraid of not getting the proper training before things are implemented, like the class two babies.",Negative
A lot of the travelers have only done labor and delivery. They aren’t comfortable taking the babies. It can be detrimental on nights that there isn’t a core staff person.,Negative
"A lot of us have been promised education outside of here, but we under utilize our partnerships with UC Davis and others. A lot of the times are so short staffed we can’t bring people off to train.",Negative
"They sent us these online training modules that we had to complete to take care of sicker more preterm infants - and that’s it. We can’t sufficiently take care of these infants. Then they said they wanted to send us to Davis to train, but we don’t have enough people to run the floor. We weren’t brought into the decision at all.",Negative
I don't know who I report to.,Negative
There are so many things that are done here and we are just going in there and winging it until a staff member tells us how to do it.,Negative
"It’s not the travelers fault, they don’t get orientation because they are originally going to be there for a month but they often extend and then they have to ask April for stuff.",Negative
A big problem is that these crisis travelers get no orientation without having access to the computers and without having any training. They don’t know anything about our unit. I’m constantly training new people over and over.,Negative
April is the only staff nurse on nights and she has to help all these travelers with their questions and our process of doing things.,Negative
"People originally come for four weeks, but then they almost always extend. They aren’t put through training or learning. It’s, “they are only here for 4 weeks, we aren’t going to take the time to train them.” It’s ,”we aren’t giving them orientation because they are only here for four weeks,” but they aren’t.",Negative
"The fact that we are hiring them to a unit like this, then they say they don’t have experience doing xyz, we shouldn’t be hiring them to this unit.",Negative
The nurses they are bringing in have never taken care of a baby or postpartum. When there are three of them and no staff what then happens if a baby has to go to the nursery. Something is going to happen.,Negative
Positive feedback would be nice every now and then. That’s pretty rare.,Negative
Our experience isn’t being recognized and we don’t feel like they care about what we’ve done while we’ve been here.,Negative
The hospital advertised that we have lactation consultants and one of the nurses was able to do that. She scheduled a meeting with Julie and Tanya about getting an extra dollar or two an hour because they are doing the lactation consulting. They weren’t being recognized at that point; it wasn't even on their badge at that time. She scheduled this meeting but they just disrespected her request to recognize her as a lactation consultant when they were advertising for that service.,Negative
"We had a serious patient that resulted in a big debrief and the nurses that were taking care of this patient on OB did not get invited. It was scheduled during a time they couldn’t even join the meeting. It was the doctors and admins patting themselves on the back about how good they did, and they didn’t involve the nurses who actually were doing the patient care.",Negative
"I think there is this natural tendency for staff nurses to just say, “well you’re a traveler.”",Negative
I think we can learn alot from travelers and I don’t think that's happening.,Negative
It seems to me the people that have been here are quite tight and the travelers are a separate thing.,Negative
"Tanya expects them to train the new nurses, and some don’t want to take that time to help the travelers.",Negative
There’s two different kinds of travelers. There are the ones who work hard and then there’s people who are lazy and don’t fit in so they just travel around and now it’s more about money too. It’s a concern to get lazy nurses,Negative
"I know there were some travelers that blatantly disregarded rules, e..g not show up for their shifts, or come in at different hours. There was no calling out of that.",Negative
"Until we have time to determine if the traveler is serious or not (did it for the money, until we can suss this out, there’s a “hey hi” and not overwhelmingly welcoming.",Negative
There is a perception that the travelers can get away with murder because the demand for them is high. They aren’t as flexible with their schedule where even if it isn’t in the contract they refuse to work certain days. That would never fly elsewhere.,Negative
"Working at night we’ve had issues with unsafe, horrible travelers that we’ve gone to Tanya about. It feels like what we say or feel about these travelers doesn’t matter at all. She will renew them.",Negative
"There is a lack of flexibility coming from travelers and I think that’s because the travelers are coming from large institutions with more resources and staff. The staff nurses all bend, but the travelers won’t do it. Then there is the perception that the travelers are being more rigid and less helpful.",Negative
"Traveling nurses have a different mentality because they come in, and they should have experience jumping from one job, but a lot of them come in with their preconceived ideas of how the unit should be and what should be provided - that’s a big challenge.",Negative
"Travelers are getting paid a lot and they don’t have to do much if there isn’t a delivery. If we aren’t working, a traveler was like, “I'm not going to do that, that’s not my job.” The nurses that come from big hospitals are so used to having a secretary and lab tech and all they have to do is watch a monitor.",Negative
I can confirm it was racist. The other manager also perceived it to be the exact same…,Negative
"It's the subtle under the table, it’s almost implicit bias.",Negative
I think there are some subtle bits of racism involved with those who don't like Tanya - it’s a 99% white institution and she’s a black leader.,Negative
The same ones who complain about Tanya also complain very verbally about the travelers who are 50% black. It seems like there is some implicit bias at play.,Negative
"How I've been treated as the only hispanic girl there, the list gets longer and longer. Someone said, “Oh my god, we'll make the Mexican clean it” that person is no longer with us, but nobody ever said anything about it.",Negative
Those two nurses were black and our manager was black and it got made into a racial issue. One of our nurses complained about it and Tonya basically called her a racist and told her not to talk about it. It wasn’t racially motivated at all.,Negative
There was conflict because we felt the girls were being unsafe but we didn’t want to go to our manager because we didn’t want it to be a racial thing. That caused a lot of issues in our unit.,Negative
I like Tanya as a person,Positive
I like her management style.,Positive
Tanya is very smart and can manage well.,Positive
I really like her. She's excellent with policies and procedures.,Positive
She is one of the best nursing managers I’ve had in my career. She will answer questions honestly.,Positive
She gets stuff done.,Positive
Tanya is very open and honest.,Positive
Tanya is really flexible. She is good with me picking up whatever hours.,Positive
"Tanya communicates well with me. If I need something, she follows through.",Positive
One thing I really like is that she'll come out and work the floor with us when it's really busy.,Positive
"I love Tanya. I think that her heart is in the right place, she does everything she can to help us.",Positive
I slipped on ice and fell and Tanya covered my shift. I feel like the management is there to help and isn’t just blowing us off.,Positive
"So much has changed for the good here, if you tell her you need something and if she sees its a worthy project, she will make it happen",Positive
"I say that Tanya is very receptive and so much good about her, she’s the best manager weve ever had in this department, she gets things done, she stands up for us as a group, she has our back as the L&D team.",Positive
Tanya gives me the silent treatment for months. It’s bad. It’s really bad.,Negative
"Then when Tanya came back, she ignored me.",Negative
She’s given silent treatment to everyone on the unit and when asked to help was huffy about it.,Negative
"I told Tanya what I needed, it was a straightforward ask. I got radio silence for 3 weeks.",Negative
I think there is a lot of dishonesty - I don’t know where that stem forms. I see that in our direct manager.,Negative
We feel like our manager is not trustworthy at all. I feel like she is dishonest about a lot of things.,Negative
She will lie in people’s files to help them out. She has lied on people’s classes before to say someone had a class that they didn’t.,Negative
"Jayco was here a week ago and our manager was going around with the Jayco surveyor and was like we have a patient in this room and this room and this room and we didn’t. And the nurse said, “oh I just sent that patient home.” Julie was with her and I was wondering why they were lying to the Jayco surveyors.",Negative
Tanya comes out and says things that are inappropriate.,Negative
"The things she says to me aren’t always the truth. She brought me into the office and asked me how I felt about the travelers and she said she was going to be getting rid of them because of what has been happening and that hasn’t happened and their contract gets extended. Maybe she feels like in the moment that's the right thing to do, but then it doesn’t happen.",Negative
There is a lack of management and favoritism.,Negative
The nurses believe she has favorites. So when they get frustrated they look at the person who isn’t getting them what they need.,Negative
I feel like Tanya has people that she favors. The clerk and her are good friends and we are going to Tanya about it and she is constantly protecting.,Negative
I think the staff get frustrated with Tanya  - they feel like she favors travelers because she used to be one. She has more of a traveler mindset.,Negative
"Our raises are based on our evaluations by her, so if she doesn’t like you or has something against you, it doesn’t really matter how your performance is, she could give you a low eval and that affects your raise.",Negative
The trust thing probably comes from Tanya placating people a lot. I don’t think she is super upfront about things.,Negative
I feel like Tanya is a really great bullshiter and can get herself out of things by lying and talking her way out of things.,Negative
"I feel like Tanya doesn’t do great with confrontation with people. She doesn’t want to say, “Here's what I am seeing, we need to have a conversation about it.” Adam is doing that right now.",Negative
"Sometimes from our direct manager, the communication is disjointed. It doesn’t make sense. Face to face communication, she kind of talks around things. She wants to tell you what you want to hear but it’s not the truth.",Negative
She does try to placate people and tell them one thing that isn’t always the follow through of what happens. The results don’t reflect her words and that hurts the morale more.,Negative
"She could talk to people and have those tougher conversations - I don’t get the feeling that she enjoys them and so it’s not done. I think when someone isn’t performing well, she’ll talk to them, but it’s direct enough to create change.",Negative
"She kind of just wants you to resolve things amongst yourself. If there's conflict amongst 2 people, she doesn't get involved even if you go to her with a problem. She’ll say I'll take care of it and never does.",Negative
She uses euphemisms.,Negative
Poor communication and lack of direction.,Negative
Sometimes it’s hard to get a clear answer out of her.,Negative
"She will call me in and say, “oh well we are going to get rid of so and so,” and I’m not bringing it up, but then the next day I find out they got extended.",Negative
She doesn't always communicate well with them.,Negative
"A nurse will come out of a conversation with Tanya and be like, “what?” but she doesn’t address her concerns with Tanya directly she goes back to her group.",Negative
Tanya could be better by taking communication classes. She's not a good communicator. Most of us feel like we ask her a question and she’ll give us a paragraph answer but we don’t understand what she said.,Negative
"It seems like a lot of things we need to hear, we hear in roundabout ways. In a c-section we learned that we needed to use blue towels from a nurse in the room. We should have learned from Tanya.",Negative
"She does more physical acting out of her communication e.g. it’s “it’s this or that, it’s bop bop bop - you understand” And I really don’t understand what she means.",Negative
I felt very dismissed about what were really safety issues.,Negative
I expect a different team environment directed from the top.,Negative
Tanya doesn’t ask us how things worked in the past and how we can make it better. She’s never asked us our thoughts.,Negative
"Tanya doesn’t ask, she just assumes she knows things, but I don’t feel like she does know.",Negative
I told Tanya I was intimidated by this certain nurse and she just blew it off. I feel like Tanya blows issues under the table and they aren’t addressed. We had to go above her head.,Negative
"I had a schedule question and I came up with a solution and she just said, “I can’t deal with that right now,” it took me weeks to figure it out.",Negative
I feel like when we go to her with stuff she just makes us think we are silly for complaining. She brushes a lot of things off when you communicate issues with her.,Negative
"We’ll agree on a policy change and Tanya will make a casual comment at nurses station instead of writing something to them. She shrugs it off and says,  “guys just figure it out”.",Negative
Our manager doesn’t delegate things to us. She just assumes responsibility.,Negative
"She says, “I got this all the time.” We would feel more respectful and empowered if we were delegated some decisions. It feels disrespectful.",Negative
It would be nice if Tanya took suggestions and cared about the opinions of those of us that are here.,Negative
"She will say, “this is what we are going to do,” and everyone should agree that it’s useful for the unit. She has her own plan and just rolls with it. There could be more staff input.",Negative
Tanya talks about other nurses in her unit.,Negative
She will talk about other people which I feel is unprofessional. We know who she likes and doesn’t like..,Negative
I feel like Tanya is unprofessional - she will gossip to us about other nurses. That’s where a lot of the lack of trust for me comes in. She is obviously doing that about all of us.,Negative
She has created a lot of conflict between employees by gossiping with certain people and telling them dishonest things. Then the person is upset with someone else when it’s not true information.,Negative
I don't think she’s doing a good job. I know she thinks she’s doing a good job.,Negative
"She’s too hands off, when things aren't going well in the unit.",Negative
She will let things go and not react in areas when there were clearly wrong doings and not getting involved.,Negative
I don't particularly have confidence in her ability to manage and I feel bad about that.,Negative
"She’s overtrusting sometimes. She didn’t ask me any interview questions, she is quick to trust every traveler and that may not filter out the issues.",Negative
Adam has helped morale.,Positive
I really enjoy him.,Positive
Adam has been a breath of fresh air.,Positive
Adam has been good at the positive feedback; it seems like it’s lifting up the unit a bit.,Positive
Adam definitely wants to help. He’s doing all this for the right reasons. He’s a good person.,Positive
The new supervisor Adam is trying to make some positive changes.,Positive
I think Adam has been an impressive part of positive change. He is a good layer in between Tanya and the nursing staff.,Positive
Adam has taken some stress off Tanya now that he can also work on the floor and Tonya can take on a more managerial role.,Positive
Now that Adams is here I think Tonya can focus on more management things. We can have those staff meetings and open discussions.,Positive
Tanya is so busy. I don’t think she had the bandwidth before Adam.,Positive
I feel like I can trust Adam.,Positive
Adam wants to hear all perspectives.,Positive
Adam is very easy to get a hold of and he’s very receptive to all my questions. I don’t think I need anything.,Positive
Now it’s Adam and he’s here in a heartbeat. It’s reassuring to know there’s someone here when you need them.,Positive
"Before Adam came we were really starting to lack communication, but it’s been better since he’s been there.",Positive
"He’s positive, but also doesn’t sugar coat.",Positive
He’s a clear communicator and deeply cares. He doesn’t stir up drama.,Positive
Now that Adam is here it’s easier for Tanya to divide and conquer. Adam has been good at approaching situations.,Positive
"Adam was able to talk with a nurse that was pretty bad and say, “this is how you are coming across in your communication,” and then I worked with her again and she was much better.",Positive
Adam communicates well with me. He’s very helpful with the nurses. He is very hands on from my observation.,Positive
Now that there is two of them Adam does a good job at communicating when policies are changing for example.,Positive
"He doesn’t take conflict very well, he just lets nurses say whatever.",Negative
"He will circle back around, but sometimes I wish he would say things in the moment.",Negative
He watches people come in at 7:05 and says nothing.,Negative
"He knows how to address things, but doesn’t address it at the moment.",Negative
"I feel like Adam lets the nurses get away with a lot. He doesn’t take conflict very well, he just lets nurses say whatever.",Negative
I look forward to coming to work every day.,Positive
We have a great team. I am proud to work here.,Positive
I would just like to thank Rainbow for the opportunity of working here.,Positive
"I like my Job, proud to be a part of RMWD and serve our rate payers!",Positive
I feel nothing short of gratitude to work for RMWD. That gratitude motivates me daily to  do whatever I need to get my job done and do it to the best of my ability.,Positive
"RMWD is a great place to work, I have zero complaints.",Positive
"Great place to work, everyone gets along and is willing to help.",Positive
"overall great place to work, everyone is friendly and are willing to help out.",Positive
Very happy at the district and how it’s run. Very impressed and inspired by my supervisor and operations manager.,Positive
Never experienced getting a hard time for balancing work and personal life which has  been wonderful.,Positive
My Pay+Benefits are really good for my position so much so that moving into a higher  position elsewhere isn't worth the jump.,Positive
Hopefully the survey input will be given sincere consideration so RMWD can continue to  be a great place to work.,Positive
Love the newsletter! It’s so fun!,Positive
Satisfied how improvements are being made.,Positive
"A couple months ago, I would have said I am completely burned out. So, I guess that is  progress.",Positive
Keep communicating with District employees regarding District changes or Board  decisions San Diego Water Authority.,Positive
Thank you for caring enough about Employees to send out this Survey. Many  companies don't do this.,Positive
The updates on the progress of the various large projects going on in the district and the  opportunity to give input to the development of upcoming / future projects is greatly  appreciated. Please continue to keep us updated and involved.,Positive
The District has been incredibly flexible with schedules to meet the additional needs  posed by COVID.,Positive
"In talking to other people about their workplaces, RMWD is doing as well or better in  responding to Covid-19. Our social tracking, notification and quarantine procedures are  better than most.",Positive
My personal and family life has never been better and that is because I work at RMWD  and it provides me the work life balance that I've longed for. Especially this year through  the pandemic and work from home/scheduling flexibility the District has offered. I  couldn't be more grateful for my job.,Positive
Great job.,Positive
Doing a good job.,Positive
Keep doing what you're doing.,Positive
Satisfied how GM is leading the district.,Positive
Keep being awesome.,Positive
Keep up the good work!,Positive
He is an excellent and very intelligent leader.,Positive
I am satisfied with the General Managers leadership.,Positive
Just keep on doing what he’s doing seems to be working.,Positive
I think Tom is doing a good job. He cares about our rate-payers and he supports  employees' commitments to their families.,Positive
"Tom - your care for our Community and Ratepayers is real and genuine and very much  respected. Please don't ever change that. I believe you also have a heck of a  Management Team! A Dream Team, if you ask me! (...no I am not a Manager) but  please take good care of the Management Team! They also deserve to be  acknowledged for their hard work..!",Positive
Continue doing what you are doing.,Positive
Keep up the good work.,Positive
Keep heading the right way. Make Rainbow a model other District's look up to. ,Positive
Continue to be transparent.,Positive
"I struggled to answer ""I trust my co-workers.” That is a ""somewhat agree"" for me because the statement is so generalized. I trust SOME, but not all. Primarily because I don't know them very well, so many are new and with 2020 we hardly get to know one another on a deeper level than just identifying who they are by name and ""hearing"" from the grapevine if they are great employees or not.",Negative
Communications between top management and employees could be improved and be  more free flowing.,Negative
"It'd be nice if managers make changes to processes and systems, if they'd follow up with  the employees affected to see how things are working out.",Negative
"I feel there is still a bit of a missing link in communication between departments partially  due to a desire for departments to ""get the credit"" for accomplishments.",Negative
Acknowledgments of good work & praise of individuals are based on the relationships they have with said individuals or who that individual has a relationship in Top Management.,Negative
Some managers are untrustworthy and do not provide proper responses.  ,Negative
Management in Field Operations is very knowledgeable and trustworthy. Top Management in the rest of the areas are very knowledgeable but NOT trustworthy. ,Negative
"I do agree I am somewhat acknowledged for a job well done, I can't disagree with that,  but It would be nice to receive genuine appreciation more on the spot or often.  ",Negative
Appreciation for a job well done is more often shared for new leadership team members  and their departments with new employees as opposed to the smaller departments with  seasoned employees who consistently work behind the scenes to support those  employees who are acknowledged.,Negative
"Keep it up in general, but the way you (the general manager) praise some departments  and make backhanded slights at others can be very demotivating. For example,  ""Engineers are Great, but Operations is where we get things done."" This is very  demotivating for an Engineering team that is working extremely hard and actually  accomplishing a lot.",Negative
Workload can get heavy. But other departments have been stepping up and helping out.,Negative
[There needs to be] accountability for toxic Employees who are ungrateful and always  look for something to complain or gossip about.,Negative
Work expectations are high at the expense of work/home life balance.,Negative
"Any stray from a perfect score here is due to ""locker room talk"" that I hear amongst  employees. I don't get the feeling that anyone is strongly hurt by the jokes I have heard,  but they have not been dealt with in a way that makes me think there is zero-tolerance  for it.",Negative
There is one toxic person in Admin whom I and some others avoid interacting with. She  seems to insert herself in matters that don't pertain to her and asks questions about why  certain people aren't in the office more. I know at least one high-risk employee has felt  pressured to come in more to avoid the passive-aggressive comments.,Negative
To act more professional including the language that is used during meetings. (referring  to top leadership),Negative
It's hard to keep up with the workload. It does take 11-hour days and weekends to get the job done.,Negative
Workload often does not permit on the job learning and growth.,Negative
Quantity of work and deadlines are overwhelming most times.,Negative
"My department has people with the right skills, but we are understaffed.    ",Negative
"Although it seems like there are never enough hours in the day to get everything done,  we know we can count on each other.",Negative
Invest in employees work life balance and that work goals/ expectations are realistic ,Negative
Work towards matching the workload with the philosophy of work life balance.    ,Negative
These kinds of statements make me feel unsupported in balancing my personal  responsibilities with my work responsibilities.,Negative
"I get a lot of ""I don't care if you get the work done in 4 hours or 9 hours as long as the  work is getting done"" as a play at the notion that one could achieve balance by working  extensively one day to earn time off later, but in reality there is always a backlog and  never a point where the work is done.",Negative
"I would say that management says things like, ""make sure to take time off and connect  with your family."" But when I have done that, I have been given feedback such as  ""weekends are for catching up on work"" or ""I deserve the respect of getting a response  no matter when I email you.""",Negative
"I have been given the advice that if I want time with my family, I should just sleep less.",Negative
"Add to Construction's fleet: Add another 5 yard dump truck and trailer and a skid steer  with multiple attachments (sweeper, asphalt grinder, flat and teeth bucket); and add a  third utility truck.",Negative
Keep open minded/ listen to the employees Ideas they might have.,Negative
"There is a notion that the Engineering Team should be persistent at pulling information  and gathering comments from the Operations Department, which is great! But the folks  in Operations need to be given the time to make comments and review the work  Engineering is doing for that actually to be accomplished. The delay in getting comments  out of Operations has halted many projects and made it very difficult to meet design  schedules and Developer expectations. This is another example where the intention is  GREAT, but the time needed to accomplish the intention is not being given.",Negative
Be more aware of the way daily and routine matters are handled by leadership and not just the big ticket stuff.,Negative
"No succession plan is taken seriously enough. It's been a tough year. With a lot of  regular work, projects, and COVID it's hard not to have some burnout.",Negative
There are clear and specific deficiencies in some departments that are clearly  overlooked due to the relationships that the individuals in that department have with Top  Management.,Negative
Learn more about what each role contributes to the operations of the district and  encourage team members to help by learning how to do things other than their normal  routine by thinking outside the box-don't leave it for others to do because they don't  know how or why.,Negative
"When evaluating a position to look past the relationship they have with the individual in  that position. Are they in that position to please Top Management or anyone that exerts  influence in that department. Are the duties of that position being fulfilled, etc?",Negative
Continue listening to fresh ideas and trying new methods for completing tasks.  ,Negative
Ideas or concerns are treated as irrelevant and unimportant.,Negative
It would be nice to see him out in the field more often. comradery wise.  ,Negative
Be more open minded.,Negative
Trust his appointed Leaders. Trust the Managers and Supervisors on how they see their  subordinates. They work with these individuals on a daily basis. The General Managers  perceived bad experiences or great experiences with an individual does not take away  the validity of the Managers/Supervisor's point of view of their subordinates.,Negative
I've only had two one-on-one meetings in the past year. They weren't performed even on  zoom.,Negative
"I thought we are all one team and have to work together to successfully reach our goals.  However, I was also told that I received a satisfactory evaluation as opposed to  something better for teamwork because I helped other departments too much. This is  confusing messaging from upper management. Should I understand that if I want to go  above and beyond in teamwork, I should do less of it?",Negative
I feel that the tasks that stretch me and help me learn and grow have slowly been  removed from my position over the last couple years.,Negative
"While most coworkers take COVID seriously, there are a few who wear their masks  incorrectly (let it fall below the nose), or walk around and socialize (unnecessary  contact), or who take risks outside of work that could put the rest of us at greater risk. I wish they wouldn't do that.",Negative
In recent years older employees have been pushed to retire earlier than desired by the  employee.,Negative
